            <p>The most beautiful creation of God that exists all around us is nature, which is seen as being essence of everything. Water, air, plants, and many other things have been given to us by nature so that we can survive on this earth. A person with a sense of beauty will never be able to overlook the splendour of the twinkling stars and the crimson light of the rising sun. The beauty of nature has inspired many artistic people to compose verses of praise, show their creative side with paints and brushes, write beautiful prose and capture the beauty of nature with a camera forever.

            <p>It’s a blissful sight for our eyes to soak in the scenery in the mornings when the sun spreads its rays onto Earth. The grass looks greener, and the branches of the trees shimmer with the warmth of the sunshine. Everything blooms in its presence. The sun’s first rays can do wonders for our bodies. Similarly, we can be that source of light in someone’s life. We can spread our warmth by being kind to one another and making someone blossom again. Every day, the sun poured its light onto us, no matter how many times the cloud would prevent it from reaching us. We must continue to be compassionate to everyone, no matter what life throws at us. Let the sunshine be your inspiration to be a little kinder each day.
